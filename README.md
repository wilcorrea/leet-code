# Beginner PHP Exercises ‚Äì Control Structures

This repository contains a series of simple programming exercises in PHP designed for beginners who are learning how to use control flow structures like conditionals and loops. These exercises are organized into three difficulty levels, progressing from basic conditionals to more complex loop-based logic.

Each exercise is meant to be solved using basic PHP syntax, without the use of object-oriented programming. Input is taken via `fgets(STDIN)` and code is executed directly in the terminal.

## üìÅ Files

* `level-1.md`: Basic exercises using conditional structures and input/output.
* `level-2.md`: Exercises involving loops and counters.
* `level-3.md`: Exercises combining loops with conditions for more logic-based problems.

## üõ† Requirements

* PHP installed locally (version 7+ recommended)
* Access to a terminal (e.g. Windows Terminal, Git Bash, etc.)

## ‚úÖ How to Use

1. Open a terminal.
2. Create a new `.php` file for each exercise.
3. Copy the description from the appropriate level file.
4. Write your solution using `fgets(STDIN)` to receive input from the user.
5. Run the file: `php your-exercise.php`

Enjoy learning PHP!
